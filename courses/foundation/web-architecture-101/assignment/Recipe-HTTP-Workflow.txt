What happens when a user adds a recipe?

1. User clicks "Add Recipe" and fills a form on the frontend.
2. Frontend sends "POST /recipes" with the recipe JSON.
3. Backend checks fields, creates a new record, saves it to the database.
4. Backend reads the saved recipe and replies with the new recipe JSON.
5. Frontend receives the response and updates the UI to show the new recipe.
